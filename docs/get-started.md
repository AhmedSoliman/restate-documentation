# Get started
-------------------------
**What to write here**:
- This should be a more interesting example
- Should convey why Restate helps with the development of distributed applications

brainstorm:
- Should spark interest to follow the longer tutorial
- Should show the main problems it solves for you: box of tools that takes away a lot of cumbersome tasks: durable execution, reliable suspendable communication, consistent application state guarantees (single communication line to the service), long-running/faas.

- 2 services
- call each other and sleep
- keep count in state
- generated files of proto already there

should show:
- durable async/await
- easy to write
- durable await
- statefulness
- waiting for additional input from the outside. two calls
- something that is awaited with suspension
- in background

Maybe start with getting something running and sending a request. Getting a response. 
And then making a small additions such as adding a get state or an invoke.
