# A Tour of Restate
**This is work in progress...**

To get you started with Restate, this tutorial will help you develop an end-to-end example, covering all important Restate features.
After this tutorial,
you should have a firm understanding of how Restate can help you
and feel comfortable to tackle your next application on your own.

In essence, Restate is a tool that makes it easier to develop distributed applications. Distributed applications are applications that are decomposed into several independent services (microservices) that talk to each other. Each service does a specific set of tasks and communicates with other services.

In this tutorial, you implement a ticket reservation application for a theatre. You can see it as a subset of the services of a larger e-commerce application.
Users can add tickets for specific seats to their shopping cart. After a ticket has been added, the seat is reserved for 15 minutes. If it hasn't been bought and paid within that time interval, then it becomes available again to other users.

The final application will have three services:
1. User session service: keeps track of which tickets are currently in the cart of the user. 
2. Ticket service: manages all tickets that are being sold or have been sold. 
3. Checkout service: handles the checkout process of the ticket sale. This service will be added later on in the tutorial.

As we go, you will discover how Restate can help you with some intricacies in this application.

## Prerequisites
> &#x1F4DD; As long as Restate hasn't been launched publicly, you need to have access to the private Restate npm packages and Docker container. Please follow the instructions in the `restate-dist` Readme to set up access: https://github.com/restatedev/restate-dist

- [NodeJS (and npm)](https://nodejs.org) installed.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to launch the Restate runtime (not needed for the app implementation itself).

## 🚀 Let's get started!

### Setting up the tutorial
Clone the GitHub repository of the [tutorial](https://github.com/restatedev/tour-of-restate-typescript) and checkout branch `part1`:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:restatedev/tour-of-restate-typescript.git
git checkout part1
```

This GitHub repository contains the basic skeleton of the NodeJS/Typescript services that we develop in this tutorial. 

First, get all dependencies and build tools:
```shell
npm install
```

Next, generates the Typescript Protobuf code to help you write services according to your service contract.
```shell
npm run proto
```

Build the services:
```shell
npm run build
```

### Running the services and runtime
Run the user session service:
```shell
npm run user_session_service
```

In a separate terminal, run the ticket service:
```shell
npm run ticket_service
```

Launch the runtime:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
docker run -e RUST_LOG=info,restate=info --network=host ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
docker run -e RUST_LOG=info,restate=info ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Discover the services:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/services/discover -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:8080"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/services/discover -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:8082"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/services/discover -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:8080"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/services/discover -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:8082"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now see the registered services printed out to your terminal:
```shell
{"services":["example.UserSessionService"]}
{"services":["example.TicketService"]}
```

When we look at the logs of the runtime we see:
```
2023-05-15T14:36:03.767790Z INFO restate_meta::service
  Discovered service
    rpc.service: "example.UserSessionService"
    restate.service_endpoint.url: http://localhost:8080/

2023-05-15T14:36:06.224985Z INFO restate_meta::service
  Discovered service
    rpc.service: "example.TicketService"
    restate.service_endpoint.url: http://localhost:8082/
```


Mimic adding a ticket to a cart, by calling the `AddTicket` method of the user session service as follows:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/example.UserSessionService/AddTicket -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"user_id": "dkd111", "ticket_id": "Rolling-stones-A22"}'
```
This gives us back a boolean return value:
```
true
```

If the value was printed successfully, then you have a working setup. 

The repository that you cloned, contains the basis of the ticket reservation app. When you look at the `src` folder you see two Typescript files: `ticket_service.ts` and `user_session_service.ts`.

Both files contain the skeleton of a Restate service with some empty methods defined in it. 
These methods will be implemented throughout the tutorial.

The services and methods, that are exposed as RPC handlers to the runtime, are defined in the `example.proto` file. 

Remember the curl command we did earlier?
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/example.UserSessionService/AddTicket -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"user_id": "123", "ticket_id": "456"}'
```
The URL `http://localhost:9090` points to the ingress endpoint of the Restate runtime. This is then followed by `/package-name.service-name/method-name`. In `proto/example.proto`, we defined `example` as the package name, `UserSessionService` as the service name, and `AddTicket` as one of the methods. The data that is added to the request (i.e. `'{"user_id": "123", "ticket_id": "456"}'`) is the JSON representation of the messages that have been defined in `proto/example.proto`.

That's all you need to know right now about the Protobuf service definition. We will come back to this later.

Try calling some other methods and let's then move on to implementing our first Restate service. 

## Suspendable synchronous communication
One of the key parts of distributed applications is service-to-service communication. 

Let's start with synchronous calls, where a service calls another service and waits for the response. 

### Synchronous calls
When the user adds a ticket to his cart, this invokes the `addTicket` method in the user session service.
The `addTicket` method first needs to reserve the ticket if it is available. It does that by calling the `reserve` method of the ticket service.

Let's have a look at how to do this in Restate. Add the highlighted code snippet to the `addTicket` method in the user session service.
```typescript
async addTicket(request: ReserveTicket): Promise<BoolValue> {
    
  // highlight-start
    const ctx = restate.useContext(this);
    const ticketServiceClient = new TicketServiceClientImpl(ctx);
    const success = await ticketServiceClient.reserve(
            Ticket.create({ ticketId: request.ticketId })
    );
  // highlight-end
  
    return Promise.resolve(BoolValue.create({ value: true }));
}
```

To interact with Restate, we need to retrieve the `RestateContext`. This is the entrypoint of all communication with the runtime. That is done in the first line of the code snippet:
```   typescript
const ctx = restate.useContext(this);
```

To resolve this, make sure you have the following import:
```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
```

Once we have access to the `RestateContext`, we can call the ticket service.
For this, we need to create a client for the ticket service. 

```typescript
const ticketServiceClient = new TicketServiceClientImpl(ctx);
```

We supply the RestateContext of the current invocation (`ctx`) to the client to make sure that it sends the requests to Restate, in a way that Restate understands them.

The client is an instance of the `proto-ts` client that was generated when we ran `npm run proto` earlier.
We can now use this client to call the `reserve`  method of the ticket service as follows:

```typescript
const success = await ticketServiceClient.reserve(
  Ticket.create({ ticketId: request.ticketId })
);
```
The reserve method returns a BoolValue that is equal to `true` if the ticket reservation was successful.

Let's see if this works.

Make sure that both services are running and send a request to the `addTicket` method of the user session service, as we did [previously](#running-the-services-and-runtime).

Have a look at the Restate runtime logs, to see how our ingress request is processed and triggers the execution of the `addTicket` and `reserve` methods.

### What actually happened?
The call we just did, seems like a regular RPC call. But under-the-hood, Restate does a number of things to make sure that this call is executed durably and ...

When we do a call like this, a series of steps get executed.
- The runtime receives our request and persists it.
- The runtime establishes a connection to the user session service.
- The runtime invokes the service method, by sending the request over the connection.
- The user session service starts executing the `addTicket` method.
- The user session service then sends a request to the ticket service. It sends this request over the open connection to the runtime. 
- The response of the other service can take long so the user session service suspends.
- The runtime durably logs the call.
- The runtime forwards the connection to the ticket service. (Note: the runtime makes sure these requests are done and takes care of retries. The details on retries will be covered later. )
- Once the runtime has received the response, it wakes up the user session service. 
- The code gets replayed up to the point of the request. And then the rest of the method gets executed.

The suspension mechanism of Restate is especially beneficial if you run with AWS Lambda.
You can do synchronous calls without paying for the idle time when waiting for a response.
But also for long-running services this system can be helpful because Restate makes sure that an invocation is durably recorded and can survive any failures.

To show how this works in practice and mimic that the ticket service is doing some processing for a certain amount of time, we can add a sleep call to the `reserve` method of the ticket service.
```typescript
await setTimeout(5000);
```
Then run the example and call the `addTicket` method, which calls the `reserve` method.
Show in the logs that the `addTicket` method gets suspended for 5 seconds.

:::caution
This is not the proper way to sleep in a Restate application! The Restate SDK offers you a way to do sleeps that are suspendable! Read on to find out how to do this.
:::

Explain how replay works.

Maybe include a little video demo of knative on minikube to show how containers are spun up and torn down.

## Reliable async communication without queues

The calls we did in the previous section always waited for a response to the request (albeit in suspended mode). 
It is also possible to do async calls via Restate, where you do not wait for the response.

The syntax is very similar. All we need to do is wrap the call with `inBackground`, as follows:
```typescript
const ctx = restate.useContext(this);
const ticketServiceClient = new TicketDbServiceClientImpl(ctx);
await inBackground(() =>  ticketServiceClient.reserve(
  Ticket.create({ ticketId: request.ticketId })
));
```

Show that this works.
- Run both services in separate terminals 
- Then call the usersession service addTicket method. 
- Show the logs of both services. 

## Awakeables
TODO: not yet included in the ticket reservation example

Synchronous and asynchronous calls tie services together and allow executing workflows by having several services execute parts of it.
The calls we did until now were always in between Restate services.
But what if you want to do a part of the tasks in an external service.
For example, you want a Restate service to put a message on Kafka, have it ingested by a non-Restate service.
Do some processing. And then invoke the Restate service again to continue its work. For this, you could use awakeables.
This works similar as what is known as the callback task token pattern. You generate an ID.
You supply that ID to the external service. Once the external service is done with the work, it sends the ID back to Restate.
And when Restate receives the ID, it continues processing.

So how can you do this with the Typescript SDK?

```typescript
const awakeable = ctx.awakeable<string>();

const id = awakeable.id

// send the ID to some external system

// Await on the ID to be send back to the runtime
const result = await awakeable.promise;
```

Calling `ctx.awakeable` gives you an object with two entries. A String ID and a promise. The promise gets resolved with a payload that the external service can attach to it.
You need to supply the data return type when you create the awakeable. In this case, the return payload will be a String.

Similar to synchronous and asynchronous communication, the function is suspended while it is waiting on the return of the ID.

## Durable timers

### Suspendable sleep
Earlier in this tutorial, we showed how Restate suspensions work by letting the ticket service sleep. 

Restate gives you sleep that suspends.
```typescript
const ctx = restate.useContext(this);

await ctx.sleep(5000);
```

Show how the services are now both suspended During the sleep. Then the ticket service comes back. Then the user session service comes back. Then the response comes back. 

### Delayed calls
After a timeout we want the reserved ticket to become available again.
What we want to do there is implement a delayed call after a duration that expires the reservation and calls unreserve().
```typescript
await inBackground(() => ticketService.unreserve(), 15*60*1000);
```

Put the delayed call on a low duration and show that it takes place.

## Concurrency
- writing the proto files
  => how to write them, keyed/unkeyed/singleton, key specification

If you have a keyed service, you have the guarantee that there is at most one concurrent invocation per key.
If you have an unkeyed service, then
In a singleton service, there is always at most one invocation going on. Y

Add checkout service

## Persistent application state
In our user session we actually also want to keep track of which tickets were reserved by the user. 

For this we can use application state. 

When the user calls the addTicket method, we also want it to save the ticket in the userSession shopping cart.
We don't need a session database such as Redis for this. We can use the Restate application state to persistently store the application state.
Currently we support key value state.
To read the state, do the following

```typescript
const cart = Cart.fromCartData(await ctx.get<CartData>("cart"));
```

Then we add the ticket and set the state to the new value:

```typescript
cart.addToCart(request.ticketId);
ctx.set("cart", cart.toCartData())
```

Add a clear cart method with clear state:
```typescript
ctx.clear("cart")
```

## State introspection
Read the state via the CLI to check what is currently in the state. 


## Side effects
Because of the retries due to resiliency we sometimes need to save something.

```typescript
const stripe = StripeClient.get();

const idempotencyKey = await ctx.sideEffect<string>(async () => uuid());

await ctx.sideEffect<boolean>(async () => await stripe.call(idempotencyKey, amount));
```

## Resiliency

### Runtime configuration
  => configuring retries, retryWithBackoff,

  => show in the logs

### SDK utilities for retries

```typescript
const doPayment = async () => stripe.call(idempotencyKey, amount);
const success: boolean = await RestateUtils.retryExceptionalSideEffectWithBackoff(ctx, doPayment, 100, 500)
```
